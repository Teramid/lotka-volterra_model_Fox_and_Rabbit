# lotka-volterra_model_Fox_and_Rabbit
The application showcases an artificial life model that is built upon the Lotka-Volterra model. While not flawless, this model incorporates additional features such as the simulation of individual positions within their environment. The environment includes both predators (foxes) and prey (rabbits) existing together. By adjusting parameters like reproduction rates, mortality rates, and efficiency, the expected behavior of these individual organisms can be simulated. Users also have the ability to modify parameters such as world size, initial quantities of foxes and rabbits, as well as simulation speed.

It's important to note that when the world size exceeds 100x100, the application's performance might experience negative effects.
